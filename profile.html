<br> I am Swetha V, from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. </br>
<br> <i> I am from the CYS department. In this webpage, let us speak on Cyber Forensics. </i> </br>
<br>  I am intereseted in writing. I am connected to Cyber Forensics. </br>
<br> <i> <p align="center"> Cyber forensics is one of the few cyber-related fields in which the practitioner will be found in the courtroom
on a given number of days of the year. With that in mind, the following sections are derived
from the authorâ€™s experiences in the courtroom, the lessons learned there, and the preparation leading up 
to giving testimony. To most lawyers and judges, cyber forensics is a mysterious black art.
It is as much a discipline of the art to demystify and explain results in plain English as it is to conduct an examination. </p> </br> <i>
